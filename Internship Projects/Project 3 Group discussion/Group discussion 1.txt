Introduction:

Web3 is the third generation of the internet currently being built, where websites and apps will be able to process information in a smart human-like way through technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Big Data, decentralized ledger technology (DLT), and more.

Web 3.0, sometimes known as Web 3, is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a decentralized network and have access to their own data. This article taught us about the technologies that are anticipated to advance and change in the upcoming years.

Web 3.0 is a decentralized internet to be run on blockchain technology, which would be different from the versions in use, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.

This new technological dimension believes in leveraging the power of A.I., machine learning, and the latest technologies like blockchain to solve the problems of the present-day internet/online ecosystem.

Web3 Used For
1) Metaverse
2) Blockchain Gaming
3) Creator Economy
4) Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs
5) Decentralized Finance (DeFi)


Web3 (or Web3): Read-Write-Own (Coming)
Web3 is the next stage of the web evolution that would make the internet more intelligent or process information with near-human-like intelligence through the power of AI systems that could run smart programs to assist users.

Tim Berners-Lee had said that the Semantic Web is meant to "automatically" interface with systems, people and home devices. As such, content creation and decision-making processes will involve both humans and machines. This would enable the intelligent creation and distribution of highly-tailored content straight to every internet consumer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features of Web3
To really understand the next stage of the internet, we need to take a look at the 5 key features of Web3:

Ubiquity
Semantic Web
Artificial Intelligence
Spatial Web and 3D Graphics
Decentralization through blockchain

Artificial Intelligence – One of the primary features of Web 3.0 will be its ability to decipher human emotions and thoughts. Artificial Intelligence or AI will be used extensively to filter data and content and to tailor the search results according to the user’s preference.

Semantic Web – Semantics is the study of the linkages between words. The semantic web would enable the computer to analyze data and decode the meaning and emotions that they are trying to convey. This will help in giving a better and more pleasing internet usage experience to the users.

Ubiquity – Ubiquity means the power to be present everywhere at the same time, or in simpler words, ubiquity means omnipresence. Now Web 2.0 or the internet as we know it today is already quite omnipresent. So Web 3.0 will simply take it a step further by making the internet more widely accessible using the Internet of Things (IoT).   

3D Graphics – Web 3.0 will bring in the new graphics technology, making the three-dimensional virtual world a reality. The use of 3D graphics will make the internet user experience more immersive and will also be helpful in transforming a variety of sectors like health, e-commerce, real estate, etc.

What role will blockchain technology play in Web 3.0?

Well as far as improving the internet and increasing its efficiency is concerned, Web 3.0 powered by blockchain technology can really be helpful in many ways. Using blockchain technology the speed of transactions can improve to astonishing levels. From 7 transactions per second (TPS) with Bitcoin in the initial days to 50000 TPS with Solana today, blockchain technology can really transform the course of the future of the internet and how we are accustomed to using it. If used properly, blockchain technology can help improve not only the digital transaction sector but also the digital health care sector, supply chain sector, and many other important sectors in the market. Blockchain technology can also redefine the way we are used to seeing social media sites.

However, despite all the big promises that Web 3.0 and blockchain technology have, the implementation and adoption of these technologies in real-life scenarios will take a lot more time than we can expect. Blockchain technology, like any other technology, has a few drawbacks of its own. Thus implementing the blockchain technology in the mainstream will be a bit of a challenge, until and unless the associated problems have been dealt with. The way Web 3.0 will be adopted in the mainstream and what changes it will bring to the way we are used to is only for the time to table. But one thing is for sure the future of the internet is bound to be interesting

6 Problems With Blockchain Technology

1. Security

As safe as they may appear, blockchains are only as secure as their weakest link. For example, if someone wanted access to data shared within an exclusive blockchain, they only need access to one node in it.

That means the device that is the easiest to hack in a blockchain is a threat to the privacy of the entire blockchain. Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with blockchains.

It may be nearly impossible to forge a transaction in a blockchain, but it is possible to get a fraudulent transaction approved.

2. Transparency

There has been a lot of discussion over the integration of blockchain technology in supply chains. It looks like a great idea! After all, making supply chains transparent can provide the closure everyone needs to make ethical choices.

3. Scalability

The redundancy of blockchains makes them hard to scale. Every device in your network must have a copy of every transaction made, right from the genesis block to the most recent transaction. That means hundreds of copies of the same data!

4. Regulation

Decentralization of authority means there's no one power to enforce law and order in the network. No moderators, no leaders, not even a regulatory body!

5. Transaction Speed

The unsolved problem of sluggish transaction speed is emerging as a major challenge in blockchain adoption for practical applications. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, each transaction must be verified by the nodes before it's accepted as a block. In centralized systems, trust is put in a central governing body (government or bank), which allows them to process millions of transactions per day.


6. Energy Consumption

Blockchain technology consumes more energy than any centralized system. Not only does their redundancy cause them to consume more power than an average centralized cloud-based system, but their transaction validation method plays a great role too.

First, they require more storage than any other system. The electricity required is multiplied by the number of nodes added to a blockchain. Each node stores and processes almost as much data as a central body in any other system.



The Challenges: 

New technologies demand more processing power
It will require the user to have a high-end device to actually use Web 3.0, raising the entry barriers for users to access this technology hardware-wise

User experience complexity
It will be a bit complicated at first. It may be very useful for beginners to try to understand the structure before committing to full adoption of the technology.

Difficult to regulate
Experts believe that decentralization will lead to difficulties in monitoring and managing Web 3.0, which could lead to a rise in cybercrimes.

Slow adaptation process
It took more than 10 years to go from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 and it will take at least as long, if not longer; running and completely transforming the web using Web 3.0.

Easy access to user’s personal and public data
Web 3.0 is huge and interconnected, which means that it’s easier for any individual to gain access to the public and private information you share online. What can lead to hackers and information theft

Existing websites will need an upgrade
As Web 3.0 – based websites and applications become popular, digital businesses will be under increasing pressure to upgrade their digital offerings, so that they do not lose their captured market.

It’s not eco friendly
Once people realized how much energy was going into Bitcoin mining, environmentalists started wondering why we’re burning so much fossil fuel just to execute an elaborate consensus protocol. Some estimate that Bitcoin consumes more power than a small country – and that’s just before the latest adjustment of the hashing rate for the miners.

Some cryptocurrency zealots say there’s no other choice. Proof of work is outrageously expensive but it’s the only chance of working. If it’s maintained, then building out Web 3.0 is going to require a lot of energy.

Web3 is here to change the course of history again and today we are a part of it. With enormous potential for Web 3.0, we also see that it has many challenges that must first be overcome in order to reach the goal that they hope for.

What do you think? Is Web 3.0 a reality or a dream?

What You Need To Know Before Implementing a Blockchain Business Strategy

Any Blockchain business idea should always take into consideration three key factors, they include:

Value of Blockchain Technology
Short-Term Return on Investment to Scale for Growth
Tailoring Plan for long-term scalability

Value of Blockchain Technology: 
The value of the digital ledger technology in a blockchain business network is one that continues to affirm its credibility as the technology of the 21st century. Blockchain is a second generation technology as it is set to revolutionize various sectors of the economy.

Being a global distributed ledger, blockchain allows the handling of items of value such as money to music as well as votes without the need of intermediaries. Getting rid of intermediary’s results in a reduction in transaction complexity as well as unnecessary costs regardless of blockchain business strategy of use.

Blockchain business models also leads to improvements in transparency as well as fraud controls, allowing businesses to generate maximum value from their operations.

Short Term ROI Using Blockchain Technology
While exploring a blockchain business strategy, it is important to come up with a scalable project. For a business to achieve the desired growth, it must be clear on the short term, the probable return on investment. Setting short-term goals is a must, as a way of accruing the actual benefits of the technology.

A business engaged in the supply chain business could structure its blockchain business strategy at first, to focus on reducing the costs of operation. The technology can in return help eliminate discrepancies in the supply chain process as well as product loss, therefore speed up shipping times.

Cost reduction is one of the most successful short-term goals as a way of achieving a return on investment on leveraging blockchain technology.

Tailoring Blockchain Business Idea for Scalability
Integration of short-term and long-term blockchain business strategies on the initial strategy is essential. Finding a way of integrating the two is a sure way of enjoying the full benefits of the ledger technology. For example, a pharmaceutical company can use technology, in the short-term, to reduce product loss as well as shipping time, therefore, increase success rates.

To scale in future, the pharmaceutical company could configure its blockchain business model to partner with patients with a view of commercializing their data for drug research. While the short-term solutions won’t be industry changing, the long-term strategy would allow the pharmaceutical company to scale, thereby establish industry dominance.
