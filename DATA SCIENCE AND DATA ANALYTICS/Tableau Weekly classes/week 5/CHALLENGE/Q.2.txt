2) What is the difference between legends and filters? 

legends:
       The color legend can either be categorical or quantitative. 
       A categorical legend represents discrete categories such as customer names and regions 
       while a quantitative legend represents a range of numeric values such as sales and profit.
filters:
       Filtering is the process of removing certain values or range of values from a result set. 
       Tableau filtering feature allows both simple scenarios using field values 
       as well as advanced calculation or context-based filters
