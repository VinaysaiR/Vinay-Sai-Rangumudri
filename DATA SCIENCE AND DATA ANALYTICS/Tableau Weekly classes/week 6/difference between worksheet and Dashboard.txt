1) What is the difference between worksheet and Dashboard?

worksheet:
    1) A worksheet is where you build views of your data by dragging and dropping fields onto shelves. 
    2) A dashboard is a combination of several views that you can arrange for presentation or to monitor. 
    3) A story is a sequence of views or dashboards that work together to convey information.

Dashboard:
    1) A dashboard is a collection of several views, letting you compare a variety of data simultaneously. 
    2) For example, 
          1. if you have a set of views that you review every day, 
          2. you can create a dashboard that displays all the views at once, 
          3. rather than navigate to separate worksheets.

difference between worksheet and Dashboard:
    1) Like worksheets, you access dashboards from tabs at the bottom of a workbook. 
    2) Data in sheets and dashboards is connected; when you modify a sheet, any dashboards containing it change, and vice versa. 
    3) Both sheets and dashboards update with the latest available data from the data source

2) Create an account on Tableau public and publish your dashboard. Kindly publish your Week 5 challenge dashboard here.

ANS: STEPS ------>

      2) If you don’t have an account, select the link to create a new one.
      3) Type a name for the workbook and click Save.
      4) When you save a workbook to Tableau Public, the publishing process creates an extract of the data connection.
      5) After the workbook is published, you are redirected to your account on the tableau public website
